# Basic HTTP Server with Node.js

This Node.js project demonstrates how to create a simple HTTP server using the built-in `http` module. The server handles basic `req` (request) and `res` (response) operations, displaying different content based on the requested URL.

## Usage

1. Clone the project to your computer or download it as a ZIP file.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/josephnade/creating_server.git
    cd creating_server
    ```

2. Open the terminal and run the server script:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see the index page. You can also try accessing `/hakkimda` and `/iletisim` for other pages.
